Revision of this text: v2025.65

The size of <userdata> is not really zero but unkown. It fills 
the remaining space of the USB stick. The remaining entries 
therefore refer to data at the end of the USB stick.

In order to update this plan to a different LiveDVD Image, just 
change its exact byte size in the "iso_image" line.

In order to update this plan to a different USB stick, just 
changes its exact 512-byte sector size in the "end_of_usb_stick" 
line.

THIS directory "layout_plan" should contain (if possible) the 
following files ("some_image_file.iso" just being an example):

some_image_file.iso.cks
some_image_file.iso.sha256
some_image_file.iso.url
mknotice
mkplan
plan.txt
../layout_plan.tgz
../THIS_notice.txt

Note that the *.cks file also contains the byte size of the 
embedded ISO image. It should match die size reported by the 
"isosize" tool when invoked with the block device of the whole 
medium as its only argument. Use the "cksum" utility to create 
the contents of the *.cks file.

The *.sha256 file should have been created with the "sha256sum 
-b" command. It is a stronger checksum than those created by 
"cksum", but it lacks the byte size of the checksummed data which 
only "cksum" provides in its output.
